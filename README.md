# Unnamed
A language compiler built using C. For learning and fun!

The goal of this language was to compile FizzBuzz entirely, which meant writing to stdout, loops, mod operator, and if statements were required, which were all implemented.

<!-- To see how the syntax looks, checks the examples folder. -->

Quick Start:

Dependencies: gcc, nasm

<!-- ```
./build.sh
./build/unn <filename> <output_filename>
``` -->

# Compiler Journey

Join me on this wild ride as I attempt to build a compiler from scratch. Here are the steps I've taken so far:

1. [The First Step: The Janky Lexer](assets/journey/step1_janky_lexer.md)
2. [The Second Step: The Janky Lexer](assets/journey/step2_janky_lexer.md)
3. Implemented the Parser..not quiet there yet but on-track.
4. The parser works at least..not easy ngl!!
x. ... (more steps to come)
