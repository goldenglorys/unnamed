# Janky Lexer: The First Step

Welcome to the first note on my Janky Lexer project diary. If you're wondering why it's called "janky," well, that's because I have no clue what I'm doing. I'm just a guy who decided to dive headfirst into the world of lexers, compilers, and all that jazz without any prior experience. So this is going to be a bumpy ride filled with confusion, Google searches, and probably a lot of facepalms.

## Experience, Pains, and Difficulties

Oh boy, where do I even start? So, I decided to embark on this crazy journey of building a compiler. Why? Because apparently, I thought it would be a great idea to torture myself with something I have absolutely no clue about. But hey, that's what learning is all about, right? Right?!

### The Struggle is Real

First off, let me just say that I am not a genius. I'm just a dude with a computer, a lot of free time, and an unhealthy obsession with YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow. I've spent countless hours googling things like "what is a lexer?" and "how to read a file in C?". Yes, I'm that clueless.

### The First Step: The Janky Lexer

So, I started with the lexer. What's a lexer, you ask? Well, it's basically a thing that reads your code and breaks it down into smaller pieces called tokens. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong.

I began by defining some enums and structs to represent different types of tokens. Easy peasy. But then came the hard part - actually reading the file and generating these tokens. I swear, I've never used `fseek` and `ftell` so much in my life. And don't even get me started on pointers and memory allocation. I'm pretty sure I've created more memory leaks than a sieve.

### What I Learned

1. **Patience**: Coding is hard. Like, really hard. But with enough patience and perseverance, you can eventually figure things out.
2. **Google is Your Friend**: Seriously, I don't know what I would do without Google. It's like my own personal coding guru.
3. **Memory Management is a Bitch**: Pointers, malloc, free - it's all a giant pain in the ass. But it's a necessary evil, so I'm learning to deal with it.

### What's Next?

Next up, I'll be working on the parser. (But actually I have to improve on this lexer first though) Because apparently, breaking down code into tokens isn't enough. Now I have to actually make sense of those tokens. Wish me luck!

So there you have it. The first step of my janky lexer journey. It's not much, but it's a start. And who knows? Maybe one day, I'll look back on this and laugh. Or cry. Probably cry.
